# ABRickUIKit
Rich UI Controls for iOS - and eventually all other Apple platforms.

Current roadmap(for the ABMarquee text control):
1. Create a sample/test app and add link to it here.
2. Add SwiftUI support.
3. Add support for other Apple platforms.

Other controls to add:
1. Typing effect TextView(will be SwiftUI only).
2. Stats meter for an amount of time(think GitHub commit list over the past year).
3. Watch/Alarm icon that ticks per second and doesn't kill performance/the device.
